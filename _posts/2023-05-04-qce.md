<!-- ### Held in conjunction with the  IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering ([QCE2023](https://qce.quantum.ieee.org/2023)), Sep 17–22, 2023. -->


<!-- ### Overview -->
### Technical Background
The goal of computational wave imaging is to obtain hidden physical properties of a medium, such as internal density and bulk modulus, by analyzing wave signals that traverse the medium. This field finds wide-ranging applications in scientific disciplines, including seismic full-waveform inversion (FWI) for subsurface exploration, ultrasound computed tomography in the medical field, and acoustic imaging in materials science. Our tutorial will center around FWI, using it as a prime example to demonstrate the application of cutting-edge deep learning techniques. Mathematically speaking, FWI represents a challenging ill-posed inverse problem. Our team's primary objective is to explore the integration of machine learning with underlying physics to mitigate the ill-posed nature of the problem and enhance the efficiency of the solutions. This, in turn, promises more accurate, faster, and improved seismic imaging. Along these lines, we have successfully developed a comprehensive suite of techniques, encompassing data-driven 2D and 3D imaging, physics-guided data augmentation, unsupervised learning methods, and lightweight imaging approaches, among others. Many of these techniques, in conjunction with additional methods, have been detailed and discussed in our recent review paper [1]. To further engage with the scientific community, we recently released OpenFWI [2], comprising extensive multi-structural benchmark datasets. OpenFWI has been designed to foster diversified, rigorous, and reproducible research in solving FWI, facilitating ongoing advancements and innovations in this field. 
<!-- Abstract
We are currently living in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, where noise and scalability are well-known and crucial issues. We have been witnessing the rapid development of superconducting quantum computers, which gradually alleviates scalability issues where we have quantum computer with 433 qubits from IBM. However, the high noise in quantum computing is still a barrier to the use of quantum computing in real-world applications. For ibm_belem processor, the qubits error is at the level of 10^-4 to 10^-2.
Although they have great potential to work well on a fixed noise level, the change of noise will make the pre-designed noise-aware solution useless and incur high overhead for solution adaptation. Unfortunately, the noises on quantum devices are unstable. -->

<!-- objective
The objective of the proposed workshop on the unstable noise of quantum computing is to address one of the most significant challenges in the development of quantum computing, which is the issue of unstable noise. The workshop aims to bring together experts and researchers from different backgrounds to explore and share their insights on this critical problem. The objective is to provide a platform to discuss different approaches to mitigating noise, including error-correction techniques, noise-reducing algorithms, and hardware improvements.

The detailed objectives are listed as follows:
* Develop a comprehensive understanding of the current state of research on unstable noise in quantum computing.
* Provide a platform for researchers and industry experts to present and discuss their latest findings and insights on mitigating unstable noise in quantum computing.
* Foster collaboration among researchers and industry experts to develop novel techniques and strategies for addressing unstable noise in quantum computing.
* Facilitate discussions on the limitations of current techniques and identify areas where further research is needed.
* Encourage the development of reproducible quantum computing systems that can effectively mitigate unstable noise.
* Provide an opportunity for attendees to network and build new collaborations in the field of quantum computing. -->

### Proposed Tutorial

Our objective with this tutorial is to provide our audience with a solid starting point, equipping them with the knowledge and resources to embark on their own research endeavors. We anticipate that the insights gained from this tutorial will empower participants to pursue their research aspirations effectively. Particularly, we will deliver a research presentation regarding our R&D as well as a hands-on tutorial to go through our openly released software package and datasets. We will demonstrate how to solve wave imaging on various computing environments including both GPUs clusters and edge devices. The topics would be of great interest to students and faculty members from data science, computational imaging, and computational mathematics, as well as to practitioners from industry. This tutorial will be a hands-on demonstration to guide participants through the concepts and practical implementation using Python codes within the Jupyter Notebook.

### Target Audiences

Entry-level to mid-career graduate students, with a strong interest in imaging science and machine learning, and with a foundational understanding of inverse theory, fundamental deep-learning techniques, and basic Python programming skills. These prerequisites will ensure that participants can fully engage with and benefit from the material presented.
